# EVSIM Internship README

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during my 6-week internship at EVSIM focusing on the development and verification of an Electric Vehicle Simulation . The primary objectives were to verify the existing Simulink and MATLAB models, and to create a MATLAB App Designer application that replicates the Unity version of the tool to streamline the process.

## Project Structure

- **Simulink and MATLAB Verification**
  - **Simulink Models**: Contains the Simulink models used for the EVSIM tool.
  - **MATLAB Scripts**: Scripts used for verification and testing of the Simulink models.
  - **Verification Reports**: Documentation and reports generated during the verification process.

- **MATLAB App Designer**
  - **App Files**: Source code for the MATLAB App Designer application.
  - **User Interface**: Design files and assets for the app's user interface.
  - **Documentation**: User guides and technical documentation for the app.

## Internship Objectives

1. **Simulink and MATLAB Verification**
   - Checked and verified the existing Simulink models and MATLAB scripts.
   - Ensured the models accurately represented the EVSIM tool's functionality.
   - Generated verification reports detailing the findings and any necessary adjustments.

2. **MATLAB App Designer Application**
   - Developed a MATLAB App Designer application to replicate the Unity version of the EVSIM tool.
   - Streamlined the process of finding different parameters for an EV, such as temperature, range, fuel, and tire pressure.
   - Based on user inputs like road condition, type of vehicle, and fuel tank size, the app provides detailed outputs.

## Features of the MATLAB App

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation and input.
- **Parameter Calculation**: Calculates and displays key EV parameters based on user inputs.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time feedback and updates as inputs are adjusted.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive user guides and technical documentation included.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2022a or later
- Simulink (if working with Simulink models)
- MATLAB App Designer

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd evsim-internship
   ```

3. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.

### Running the App

1. Open the MATLAB App Designer file (`EVSIMApp.mlapp`) in MATLAB.
2. Run the app by clicking the "Run" button in the App Designer interface.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input data and view the results.

## Usage

### Simulink and MATLAB Verification

- Open the Simulink models in the `Simulink Models` folder.
- Run the MATLAB scripts in the `MATLAB Scripts` folder to perform verification.
- Review the verification reports in the `Verification Reports` folder.

### MATLAB App Designer Application

- Open the `EVSIMApp.mlapp` file in MATLAB App Designer.
- Input the required parameters (e.g., road condition, vehicle type, fuel tank size) using the app's interface.
- View the calculated parameters (e.g., temperature, range, fuel, tire pressure) in real-time.
